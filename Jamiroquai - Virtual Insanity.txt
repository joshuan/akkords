Virtual Insanity - Jamiroquai

1st Verse:

Oh Yeah,
What we're living in (let me tell ya)
It's a wonder man can eat at all
When things are big that should be small
Who can tell what magic spells we'll be doing for us.
And I'm giving all my love to this world
Only to be told
I can't see
I can't breathe
No longer will we be
And nothing's going to change the way we live
Cos' we can always take but we can never give
And everything's changing for the worse,
See, it's a crazy world we're living in
And I just can't see that half of us immersed in sin is all we have to give

Chorus:

Futures made of Virtual Insanity - now
Always seem to, be govern'd by this love we have
For useless twisting of new technology
Oh now there is no sound - for we all live underground

2nd Verse:

And I'm thinking what a mess we're in
Hard to know where to begin
If I can slip the sickly ties that earthly man has made
And now every mother, can't choose a colour
Of her child
That's not natures way
Well that's what they said yesterday
There's nothing left to do but pray
I think it's time I found a new religion
Waoh - it's so insane
To synthesize another strain
There's something in this
Future's what we have to see

(Chorus)

Now there is no sound
If we all live underground
And now it's all virtual insanity
Forget your virtual reality
Oh there's nothing so bad, I know yeah

Virtual Insanity is what we're living in
