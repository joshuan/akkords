              C
Won't you be my
              E
Won't you be my
              Am
Won't you be my valentine
            G
Because I adore you
                   F
I'd give anything for you
             C              E
You make me smile, smile, smile

 	           ะก
And when I'm around you
				  E
Things get kinda hazy
               Am
Because I am crazy, crazy for you
              G
I cannot describe it
				 F
Except that I am in love
				   C 					  E
Yeah, I'm feeling feelings, feelings for you
 

CHORUS: 
               F                    C
And now I'll shout to the world my love for you
         E                        Am    G
The irresistible love that I've fallen into
 F                        C
Life is wonderful, cause you shine through
E                                      Am        G
There's no one that makes me feel like you do
 
And I will sing because your beautiful in all that you are
Like a clear night sky graced by a shooting bright star
So, won't you be my, won't you be my
Won't you be my sweet valentine
 
Oh and, I will stay true
I will stay true, I will stay true, true to you
From the day that I met ya', I couldn't forget ya'
You stuck in my mind, mind, mind
 
Every time that you laugh, every time that you smile
My heart it melts, I could stay here a while
And it's pure satisfaction, the kind of attraction
Chemical reaction, I have in my heart
 
And now I'll shout to the world my love for you
The irresistible love that I've fallen into
Life is wonderful, cause you shine through
There's no one that makes me feel like you do
 
And I will sing because your beautiful in all that you are
Like a clear night sky graced by a shooting bright star
So, won't you be my, won't you be my
Won't you be my
Sweet valentine
