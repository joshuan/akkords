Ed Sheeran - Perfect

           G        Em
I found a love for me
              C                            D
Darling just dive right in, and follow my lead
                G              Em
Well I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
          C                                    D
I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
                                 G                 
Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
              Em                     C                G D
Not knowing what it was, I will not give you up this time
                  G                          Em
But darling just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
            C                    D
And in your eyes you're holding mine


      Em   C              G          D             Em
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
 C                G     D               Em
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
          C                 G                D               Em
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
         C                 G        D         G
But you heard it, darling you look perfect tonight


                G                   Em
Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
                C                                         D
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
           G              Em
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
          C                             D
To carry love, to carry children of our own
                              G                     Em
We are still kids, but we're so in love, fighting against all odds
               C               G D
I know  we'll be alright this time
              G                              Em
Darling just hold my hand, be my girl, I'll be your man
          C             D
I see my future in your eyes


      Em   C              G          D             Em
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
 C                G     D                Em
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
        C                G                D
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
   Em      C                    G        D         G
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight


Em C G D
M-m-m-mmmm...


      Em   C              G          D             Em
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
 C                G     D                Em
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
        C               G
I have faith in what I see
           D             Em        C
Now I know I have met an angel in person
      G        D
And she looks perfect, 
   C 
I don't deserve this
 G        D           G
You look perfect tonight
